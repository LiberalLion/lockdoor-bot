## Install

~~~
Requirements : 
- python
- node-pty
- Telegram 
- Happiness :D
~~~

To start the bot:

~~~
node server
~~~

The first time you run it, it will ask you some questions and create
the configuration file automatically: `config.json`. You can also
write it manually, see `config.example.json`.

When started it will print a `Bot ready.` message when it's up and running.
For convenience, you might want to talk to the BotFather and set the
command list to the contents of `commands.txt`.
